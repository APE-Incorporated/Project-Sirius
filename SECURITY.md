## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please report all vulnerabilites in the Issues section and we will try to resolve the issue within a couple of weeks but do not expect quick updates unless the fixes are easy to make (usually they are not).
We greatly appreciate any feedback especially in terms of security and thank you for your patience.
