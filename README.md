**Q**: What is good?
**A**: What over 50% of developers deem to be good.

**Q**: What is bad?
**A**: Anything not Lotus Biscoff.

**Q**: Who can disobey these instructions?
**A**: Not you nor the next person. Not even if you own this repository. Not even if you've been given permission, the illusion of permission, or any other form form of compromise. And no, metaphysical arguments won't surpass the latter restriction. In short, nobody, under any circumstance.

## History

The annals of dog.
No naming people.

### The Holy Merge

It is wrought in the eternal will of the creator that someday the Two Branches of Sirius should finally merge properly. The day of reckoning is feared amongst all competent programmers, and otherwise dismissed by those who do not understand its gravity...

### The Great Schism

The combined forces of the opposing branches unified into one ungodly, unmergeable branch.

### The Great Disappointment

One of the developers stayed up and considered doing the Great Mergening by himself because he can't spend his time doing the right things. Instead he reinvented part of the bot. What an idiot.

### The Terrible Hackening

The Trojan Canine was the wooden dog used by the apes, during the UEACS War, to enter the server of UEACS and win the war. There is no Trojan Canine in the Iliad, with the poem ending before the war is concluded. But in the Aeneid, after a fruitless 10-year siege, the apes at the behest of Orion constructed a huge wooden dog and hid a select force of men inside, including Orion himself. The apes pretended to sail away, and the Trojans pulled the dog into their server as a victory trophy. That night the ape force crept out of the dog and opened the gates for the rest of the ape army, which had sailed back under cover of night. The apes entered and destroyed the server of UEACS, ending the war.

Thanks to Jack for fixing Arun's Raspberry Pi. That was cool.
